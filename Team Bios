Jennifer Usrey-Scott

Jennifer recently moved from Washington to Houston for the warm weather and the UT Houston Coding Bootcamp.
Jennifer’s extensive professional and educational background spans from hospitality to accounting and has led her to pursue her newest passion, full-stack web development. 
It all started when Jennifer worked for the state of Washington and received funding to create a web based program with developers.
If she’s not teaching herself how to crochet or spending time with her dogs Pandora & Gizmo, she is exploring and learning the newest technologies in programming. 
“I enjoy all of the parts especially the back-end of development, my favorite is when you get that code working right and you go, ‘oooh!’”

Anita Rodgerson

From Calgary to Nebraska and everywhere and anywhere in between Anita now calls Houston home.
Anita’s background in the sciences, love for travel and astronomy has led her to discovering the world of web development.
Having previously owned a small business in homecare to working in a science lab she realized she wasn’t being challenged
mentally or getting the satisfaction of interacting with people on projects.
Anita’s curiosity for full-stack development is that, “you can take a concept and turn it into a product while constantly 
being challenged and interacting with people from all over the world.”

Jason Saenz

Jason was born and raised in Houston, Texas, where he did some things and had some experiences. 
His work history is varied; among other things, he used his professional writing and mass communications degree in Idaho, taught high school English, and worked as a river and hiking guide in Alaska.
Somewhere along the line, he discovered a love for web development, and despite his many adventures in the Last Frontier, Jason missed the humid streets of Houston and decided to pursue his new passion.
“I like to work with functionality… I enjoy problem-solving, building and seeing the end result.”
